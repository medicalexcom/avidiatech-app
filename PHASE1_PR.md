# Phase 1 Delivery Summary

## Summary
- Ensured critical third-party clients (Supabase and Stripe) are installed and resolved so API routes compile and deploy cleanly.
- Confirmed App Router pages and API handlers build with current framework pins, covering ingestion, description, billing, tenant, and dashboard surfaces.
- Captured production build output to verify server/client boundaries and static generation paths are healthy for deployment.

## Testing
- `npm run build`
